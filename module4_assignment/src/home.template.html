    <h2>Welcome to My Menu App!</h2>
    <p>The first solution has done with separate states like it was described in the assignment. Also I have messed up some names of the files because it was difficult to understand what I'm trying to achieve and I couldn't understand the difference between controllers and components. And I didn't understand where I should place some of the controllers and how I should named them and their templates. But, anyway, it works.</p>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" ui-sref="categories">Dive in the menu #1</button>

    <p>Through the second solution I wanted to try a way with nested states. Also I have more understanding of what is going on, so I have tried to name files in more correct way. Also I have reused my component "items-list" from the first variant.</p>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-success btn-lg" ui-sref="category">Dive in the menu #2</button>
